# EMPress
---
Project Description: 
A disruptive device; a reflection on power, control, and information dynamics; an electromagnetic pulse generator. EMPress is a series of projects, of which this is just the first, that seeks to undermine, subvert, and invert power dynamics through disruptive (or disconnective) wearable. 
---
In doing so, the EMPress series takes a modern approach to communications and information theories--it upends the zeitgeist of connectivity, and instead displaces, disrupts, and disconnects power sources from their constituents (i.e. master/slave, primary/secondary, etc.). 
---
* This is a prototype for a future project that will incorporate EMPress into a wearable glove.

***WARNING: This device is an electromagnetic pulse generator--it creates a VERY high voltage and curent (about 4000 volts).

Components:
1. High voltage generator (ex. SUNKEE BLANK BLANK BLANK)
2. Electromagnetic coil with 5 turns (using 32 BLANK GAUGE wire)
3. A spark gap (more on this in the schematics)
4. An insulated project box/container (this can be bought, or made with a tool such as a laser cutter)
