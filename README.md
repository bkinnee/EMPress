# EMPress
---
Project Description: 
A disruptive device; a reflection on power, control, and information dynamics; an electromagnetic pulse generator. EMPress is a series of projects, of which this is just the first, that seeks to undermine, subvert, and invert power dynamics through disruptive (or disconnective) wearable. 
---
In doing so, the EMPress series takes a modern approach to communications and information theories--it upends the zeitgeist of connectivity, and instead displaces, disrupts, and disconnects power sources from their constituents (i.e. master/slave, primary/secondary, etc.). 
---
* This is a prototype for a future project that will incorporate EMPress into a wearable glove.
* This repository contains files and photos for two prototypes: one created with clear plexiglass, and the other with mirrored plexiglass. A short video of the latter is available here--although the effect on the TV static is difficult to see.

***WARNING: This device is an electromagnetic pulse generator--it creates a VERY high voltage and curernt (about 4000 volts). 
DO NOT USE THIS DEVICE NEAR ANY MEDICAL DEVICES (ex. pacemakers)--you can seriously injure or even kill somebody with this much power. 
This device was creative for artistic--NOT malicious--purposes.
Use all necessary precautions when working with high voltage; keep your circuit unplugged from your power source unless you are SAFELY testing it!
DO NOT USE THIS DEVICE NEAR ANY ELECTRONIC DEVICES--it is designed to disable them by sending a disruptive electromagnetic current. You are likely to damage your device or the data within it. Because of this, it may be necessary to work on this project outdoors and away from any other electronics (as is evident within the photos).

Components:
1. High voltage generator (ex. SUNKEE DC 3V To 7KV 7000V High Voltage Generator Boost Step-up Power Module)
2. Electromagnetic coil with 5 turns (using 32 AWG enamelled copper magnet wire; the enamelling must be stripped at the edges by burning it with a small handheld lighter or match)
3. A spark gap (more on this in the schematics; the wires can NOT be touching, and you should be able to see a plasma arc between the coil and the free-standing leg of the high-voltage generator.)
4. An insulated project box/container (this can be bought, or made with a tool such as a laser cutter).

References:

To easily create a CAD file for laser-cutting a box, I used https://en.makercase.com/. This site allows you to input the dimensions of your desired box--I used the "fingered" limbs in order to get the jigsaw-like shape with both the clear and metallic box prototypes. Also see the documentation folder for SVG (box.svg) and DXF (box(1).dxf) files (which can be used with CAD softwares such as Rhinoceros). Be sure to configure your laser cutter to the appropriate materials, thickness, etc.. The primary purpose of the box is to safely contain the spark gap within it. 

Additionally, I consulted this Instructables guide (in particular, the videos): https://www.instructables.com/id/Destroy-Any-Device-With-EMP-Jammer/ (created by Kedar Nimbalkar)
